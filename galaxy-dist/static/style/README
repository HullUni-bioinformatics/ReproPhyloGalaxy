GALAXY STYLE BUILDING

Requirements:
node.js             http://nodejs.org
grunt               http://gruntjs.com
phantomjs           http://phantomjs.org
    *phantomjs can be replaced with other libraries if you know what you're
    doing (it's used as an engine for sprite building), but it's the easiest to
    get up and running.

After node, grunt, and phantomjs are all installed (and on your path):

    1: navigate to the <galaxy>/static/style directory (where this file is)
    2: execute 'npm install'
    3: execute 'grunt'

The 'npm install' command will install the required modules for building galaxy
into the node_modules directory here.  If phantomjs isn't correctly installed
and on your path prior to running 'npm install', you'll see this error message:

    Warning: Sorry, no spritesmith engine could be loaded for your machine.
    Please be sure you have installed canvas or gm. Use --force to continue.

If this happens, you'll need to rerun 'npm install' after 1) ensuring phantomjs
is on your path and 2) removing the local node_modules directory (rm -rf
node_modules).
